# Netflix Movie Recommendation System

## Description
 This project implements a Netflix Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It uses Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering techniques to generate personalized recommendations. The system is built using Python for the backend and Streamlit for creating the web app interface. The recommendation model is saved using Pickle, and the app is easily deployable with Streamlit.

## Features
 Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user ratings and preferences.
 Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies based on movie attributes like genre, cast, etc.
 Real-time Data: Fetches movie information from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.
 Pickle Model: The recommendation model is saved in a Pickle file, which is loaded when the app is run.

## Tech Stack
 Backend: Python
 Frontend: Streamlit (for building the user interface)
 APIs: The Movie Database (TMDb) API
 Machine Learning: Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering
 Libraries: Pickle, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
 Version Control: Git, GitHub
